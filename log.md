# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I have created a repo for #100DaysOfCode Algorithms and implemented linear search and binary search in C++

**Thoughts** Learning algorithms properly has been in my tasks for quite some time, I hope with this challenge I would take up a disciplined approach in learning algorithms.
